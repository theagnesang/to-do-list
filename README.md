# To-do-list

## Introduction
This is a simple to-do list that allows you to create a to-do list for:
- the day
- work

As there is no database set up, the tasks will be available only for the current session.
The tasks will be removed When the session ends either by closing or refresh.
This forces you to be realistic with your list.
And you will likely clear the tasks you add.
